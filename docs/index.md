    details: I am a web front-end developer. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in 2020 and have been working in this field since then. I mainly write Vue, but I also know a bit of React and continue to learn both. Currently, I am located in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. But I feel that work should not be limited to physical space.
